# Houses of Westeros

When you play the Game of Rails, you win or you die.

You'll be making a Ruby on Rails app connecting Game of Thrones characters to their respective houses. Implement full CRUD functionality on the models. 

We will start off with two models: `Houses` and `Characters`.

## Models + Migrations

- Create ERD for Houses and Characters
- Create models for Houses and Characters
- Create migrations for Houses and Characters

## Views + Controllers

- Add views and controllers.

## Helpers

- Use links, forms, etc. to helpers.

## Routes

- Implement nested routes.

## Bonus

- Add a third model for quotes associated with a character.
